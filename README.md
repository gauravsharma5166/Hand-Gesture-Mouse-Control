# Hand-Gesture-Mouse-Control
Hand Gesture-Based Mouse Control is a Python project that uses OpenCV and Mediapipe to enable touchless mouse interaction through hand gestures. The system tracks hand movements in real-time and maps them to mouse actions, including cursor movement, left and right clicks.
